## Description
<hr>
The first API is a joke API that returns a random joke. The second API is a text-to-speech API that reads out the joke to the user. The joke API is called first, then the text-to-speech API is called with the joke text. The text-to-speech API returns a sound file which is played to the user.

## Usage
